This project demonstrates the creation of a decentralized voting app using blockchain principles.
The backend of the app is written in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum mainnet using Hardat. Its source code can be found in the folder "contracts" in the file named "votingcontract.sol".
This is just a prototype of how decentralized voting can be executed using blockchain. More functions, restriction, etc. can be added to the file as per the requirements.
To be able to run this app all node dependencies ought to be added to your directory by initializing Hardhat locally in the directory itself.
