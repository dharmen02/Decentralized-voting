This projects demonstrates the creation of a decentralized voting app using blokcchain principles.
The backend of the app is written in Solidity and deployed on Ethereum mainnet using Hardat. The code of it can be found in the folder contracts in the file named votingcontract.sol.
This is just a prototype of how decentralized voting can be executed using blockchain. More functions, restriction, etc. can be added to the file as per the requirements.
